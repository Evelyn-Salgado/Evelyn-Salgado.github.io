**Context:** In 2012, the New York Times Magazine published Charles Duhhig’s piece titled, “How Companies Learn Your Secrets,” in which he described his conversations with Andrew Pole, a Target statistician since 2002. Pole explained that the company had assigned him the task of gathering customer information to answer the question, “If we wanted to figure out if a customer is pregnant, even if she didn’t want us to know, can we?” Duhigg explored how Target’s predictive analytics department used data to anticipate customer behavior and increase profit. Through his reporting, Duhigg revealed how Target used customer data to build a prediction model capable of identifying when a woman was pregnant, estimating her due date, and delivering tailored ads, coupons, and product recommendations. Pregnant women were specifically targeted because companies found that people’s shopping habits changed most during major life events, and pregnancy was a prime opportunity for Target to shape pregnant women’s habits early on, during, and after her pregnancy.

The data science component in this case is the use of predictive modeling to infer personal information from shopping data. The ethical issue lies in the intent and transparency of this data collection. Female shoppers were unaware that Target was attempting to determine pregnancy status, and as noted in the article, Target deliberately kept the project private as they feared public backlash. The company’s secrecy itself reveals its awareness of the ethical implications.

**What is the permission structure for using the data? Was it followed?**

Target’s current privacy policy explains that it may collect and use customer data from online orders, in-store purchases, customer service interactions, loyalty programs, the Target app, and Target.com accounts. As the policy states, this information is collected because “you \[customers\] provide it to us.” The policy allows for automated data collection and third-party tracking to create a “personalized experience no matter how you interact with us \[Target\].” Even back in 2012, Target’s privacy terms technically permitted such practices. Legally, the company followed its publicly stated permission structure. Yet, the intent to predict pregnancy without explicitly informing customers reveals a serious ethical dilemma. Interestingly, although Target operated within their legal ability, using data to build a model that tracks and predicts intimate personal details without disclosure might be considered crossing into exploitation. Further, Target’s goal with this analysis and model –to increase their company profit– makes this even more ethically questionable despite its technical legality.

**What was the consent structure for recruiting participants? Were the participants aware of the ways their data would be used for research? Was informed consent possible? Can you provide informed consent for applications that are yet foreseen?**

Target customers, both in 2012 and today, consent to data collection implicitly through the terms of service and opt-in features, rather than through direct, informed consent. Simply shopping in-store or online counts as agreement. When questioned by Duhigg, Target declined to comment in detail, stating only that it was “in compliance with all federal and state laws, including those related to protected health information." While customers generally understand that companies may collect their data for marketing, they did not know that Target was using purchasing patterns (for example, monitoring when they purchased vitamins and lotion) to predict pregnancy. Given that Target uses a “Guest ID” system, this information would then be inputted, such that the shopper was marked with their pregnancy prediction on some Target data set. As previously stated, female shoppers did not knowingly consent to having such sensitive, personal, and health-related information inferred about them. Informed consent would have required explicit awareness of this use, which Target avoided for fear of making customers uncomfortable or attracting negative press. Informed consent, given target’s privacy policy, was technically there but true informed consent would have required explicit awareness of this data use, which the company avoided for worry of making customers uncomfortable or attracting negative press. Additionally, it does not seem possible for customers to consent to data applications that are yet foreseen, as they cannot meaningfully or fully understand what large corporations intend to use, or sell, their data for.

**What was the data collection process? Were the observations collected ethically? Are there missing observations?** 

Target’s data collection linked each customer’s online and in-store activity through a unique “Guest ID” that recorded every purchase and connected it to demographic data. As Pole described, Target wanted to “know everything \[they\] can.” Data were gathered through both direct interactions and automated collection, but in the case of the pregnancy model, Target inferred deeply personal information from ordinary transactions (daily purchases and company interaction) without disclosure. Today, Target’s privacy policy explicitly allows the collection of “inferences drawn \[from data you’ve given them access to\],” formalizing what was once implicit. Although the process is now legal and stated, ethical issues remain as customers still do not meaningfully understand or approve of how their data may be used. Thus, while the collection process was technically legal back in 2012, and is stated in their privacy policy, it continues to blur the line between data analysis and intrusion on customer’s privacy. Missing observations may include customers who are not a part of loyalty programs or account holders. From a data science standpoint, the missing data may weaken the predictive model, as non-target account holders or frequent shoppers are not captured. However, from an ethics standpoint, less data protects some customer’s autonomy and privacy.\

**The “Data Values and Principles manifesto” states, “As data teams, we aim too…use data to improve life for our users, customers, organizations, and communities.”**

The Data Values and Principles Manifesto states, “As data teams, we aim to… use data to improve life for our users, customers, organizations, and communities.” Target’s approach fails to meet this principle. While one could argue that predictive modeling might help expecting mothers by offering relevant products, the stronger argument is that Target’s actions primarily served its own commercial interests. The race for predicting their customers’ pregnancy status was not out of genuine care, but to win against competitors for those customers’ money. The secrecy surrounding the model, as reported by Duhigg, shows that Target never intended transparency. It is ironic that the company wished to keep its model private while exploiting private information about its customers. The data and data collection practices in this instance benefit the corporation, not the individuals whose data were used. Though Target claims to enhance customer experience, its predictive analytics program manipulates consumer behavior without explicit consent. This imbalance of benefit violates the manifesto’s standard of equitable and responsible data use, as while Target gains insight and control, customers lose privacy.

**Summary**

This ethical dilemma in data science matters because this case exposes how a large corporation is willing to violate its customers’ privacy for profit. As the article notes, Target is not unique as most major corporations have data analytics teams and predictive models designed to detect, and then influence consumer behavior to maximize revenue. In these situations, corporations and their executives benefit, while ordinary shoppers are harmed, as their data is used and inferred without meaningful consent. The ethical violations here served profit and power, as Target sought to predict pregnancy before anyone else could to capture customers at a vulnerable stage and then hid the process, which makes the practice even more ethically indefensible.

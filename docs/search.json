The graph is a product of wrangling the data set such that key words “woman, women, girl, girls, female, females” are regarded as female terms and male terms include “men, man, males, males, boy, boys.” These gendered keywords are looked for in both the Titles and Subjects of each article. After identifying how many times female or male terms are detected in the data set articles, they are displayed in the column graph above.\nTo better understand what these counts mean relative to the data set, the next step is to take the proportion of articles that mention female, male, and both. The data wrangling for this is in the code below and it’s results displayed in the graph below.\n\n\nshow code\nprop_mentions &lt;- nyt_obj |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    total_articles = n(),\n    fem_articles = sum(fem_mentioned, na.rm = TRUE),\n    male_articles = sum(male_mentioned, na.rm = TRUE),\n    both_articles = sum(fem_mentioned & male_mentioned, na.rm = TRUE)\n  ) |&gt;\n\npivot_longer(\n    cols = c(fem_articles, male_articles, both_articles),\n    names_to = \"category\",\n    values_to = \"count\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(proportion = count / total_articles) \n\nggplot(prop_mentions, aes(x= category, y = proportion, fill = category)) + geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) + \n         labs(\n  title = \"Porportion of NYT Articles Mentioning Gendered Terms (1996-2006)\",\n  x = \"Gender Mentions\",\n  y = \"Proportion of All Articles\"\n) + theme_light()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe graph above shows the proportion of articles from the New York Times that used gendered terms between 1996-2006. To find this proportion, I used the previously wrangled data to calculate each genders’ mentions proportional to the total number of articles in the data set.\nGraph Analysis 1: Between the span of the data set (1996-2006), headlines in *The New York Times* show a subtle but consistent gender imbalance. The proportion of articles mentioning men (0.0090) is slightly higher than the proportion of articles mentioning women (0.0080), while the proportion of headlines referencing both (0.0032) is relatively rare. While the differences are small, this suggests that articles that referenced females and/or males were rare, such that, once added, only about 2% of articles mentioned gender. The remaining 98% made no explicit mention of gender, or at least no mention of the keywords. This suggests that most coverage was focused on topics where gender wasn’t mentioned in the headline and/or subject. A possible reason for this maybe the political and global focus of the era, dominated by events such as 9/11 attacks and the wars in the middle east. The era’s coverage thus likely centered around conflict, policy, and international affairs rather than gendered narratives such as those including social trends, lifestyle, etc.\nAnalysis 2: Do headlines mentioning gender tend to be longer or shorter than those that don’t?\n\n\nshow code\nNYTimes_lengths &lt;- nyt_obj |&gt; \n  mutate(title_length = str_count( Title, \"\\\\S+\"),\n  gender_mentioned = fem_mentioned | male_mentioned)\n\ngender_lengths &lt;- NYTimes_lengths |&gt; \n  group_by(gender_mentioned) |&gt; \n  summarise(avg_length = mean(title_length))\n\n\n\n\nshow code\nNYTimes_lengths |&gt;\n  \nggplot(aes(x = gender_mentioned, y = title_length, fill = gender_mentioned)) + \n  geom_boxplot() + \n  labs(title = \"Title Lengths: With Gender Mentions vs. Without\",\n       x = \"Gender Mention\", \n       y = \"Title Length (words count) \" \n       ) + theme_light() + theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGraph Analysis 2: This graph shows that headlines mentioning gender (male, female, and both) tended to be slightly longer, averaging about 8.9 words per title compared to 8.2 words per title for those without gender mentions. The median length is also higher for gendered headlines, showing a small but consistent pattern. The range and presence of outliers (including some headlines that are more than 20 words) indicate that a few gendered headlines require substantially more context or description. This suggest that when gender was mentioned, The New York Times felt it was necessary to provide more context or descriptive verbiage. This may have been done to reflect additional nuance in gender-related topics, for example, a headline like ’Politics: The Democrat; Clinton Campaigns Puts an Emphasis on Women’ (1996) uses ten words, requiring additional language to emphasize both its gendered focus and its political context. Overall, this suggests that gendered headlines, even if fewer in number within the data set, tend to include more context or detail than non-gendered ones.\nFinal Analysis: What are the top 5 words that follow after “woman”?\n\n\nshow code\nafter_women &lt;- nyt_obj |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    word_after_woman = str_extract(\n      title_subj,\n      \"(?&lt;=\\\\bwomen\\\\s)\\\\w+\"\n    )\n  )\n\nafter_women |&gt; \n  filter(!is.na(word_after_woman)) |&gt; \n  select(word_after_woman, title_subj) |&gt; \n  count(word_after_woman, sort = TRUE) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(n)) |&gt; \n  head(5)\n\n\n  word_after_woman n\n1               in 3\n2              and 1\n3            bound 1\n4        dismissed 1\n5             gain 1\n\n\nSo, what comes after the “women in”..?\n\n\nshow code\nafter_women_in &lt;- nyt_obj |&gt; \n  mutate(\n  after_in = str_extract(\n  title_subj, \n  \"(?&lt;=\\\\bwomen\\\\sin\\\\s)\\\\w+\"\n  )  \n  )\n\nafter_women_in |&gt; \n  filter(!is.na(after_in)) |&gt; \n  select(after_in, title_subj) |&gt; \n  count(after_in, sort = TRUE) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(n))\n\n\n  after_in n\n1   africa 1\n2   france 1\n3 military 1\n\n\nAnalysis 3: Building on analyses 1 and 2, which showed that gendered terms are rare but lengthen headlines by a bit, the words that follow the word “women” reveal additonal context. Admittedly, one could run the code for every single term that was categorized as a female term, but for this analysis, I chose to just examine the words that came after “women.”\nThe most common word after “women” is “in”, often referring to places or institutions, such as “Africa”, “France”, or “military.” While this does not capture all female terms, it suggests that in this small sample of headlines, when women are mentioned, it is frequently in relation to locations. This aligns with analyses 1 and 2, where topics were noted to be mostly political and few were gendered, likely reflecting the era’s political focus."

Retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arslaan5/explore-car-performance-fuel-efficiency-data\n Kaggle Data Source \nMotivation\nAs a college student that will likely be purchasing a car in the next few years, I want to make an informed decisions about fuel efficiency and long-term value. Given rising gas prices and environmental concerns, I am curious how different car classes (compact cars, SUV’s, etc) compare in terms of combined fuel efficency. These differences can help me chose a vehicle that balances performance, cost, and sustainability.\nWhat I Plan To Do:Using the dataset, Car Specifications and Performance Data from Kaggle, I will examine whether smaller cars are more fuel efficient than larger ones. I will begin by visualizing the combined (highway and city) miles per gallon (MPG) across two main car types (small and large) to see the general trends in efficiency. Next, I will calculate the difference in mean MPG between the car types to understand how much more or less efficient one group is compared to the pther. Finally, I will perform a permutation test to evaluate whether the observed difference is statistically significant or if it could have occurred by chance.\nResearch Question: Do small cars have a higher combined (highway and city) MPG than large cars?\nNull Hypothesis (H0): Car size has no effect on combined MPG.\nAlternative Hypothesis (HA): Small cars and large cars have different combined MPG.\n\n\nshow code\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2) \n\ncar_data &lt;- read.csv(\"car_data.csv\")  \n\n\n\n\nshow code\nlibrary(tidyverse) \n\nsmall_class &lt;- c(\"compact car\", \"midsize car\", \"minicompact car\", \"subcompact car\", \"midsize station wagon\", \"small station wagon\", \"two seater\") \n\nlarge_class &lt;- c(\"large car\", \"minivan\", \"small pickup truck\", \"standard pickup truck\", \"small sport utility vehicle\", \"standard sport utility vehicle\")  \n\ncars_clean &lt;- car_data |&gt; \n  filter(fuel_type == \"gas\", !is.na(combination_mpg), !is.na(class)) |&gt; \n  mutate(car_type = if_else(class %in% small_class, \"small\", \"large\"))\n\nggplot(cars_clean, aes(x = car_type, y = combination_mpg, fill = car_type)) + geom_boxplot() + \n  labs(title = \"Combined MPG by Car Class Type\", \n       x = \"Car Type\", \n       y = \"Combined MPG\") + theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoxplot: This boxplot compares the Combined MPG (an average of city and highway fuel efficiency) between small and large cars. The car_type variable groups car classes into “small” and “large”, and the plot shows the distributions, median, and outliers of MPG for each car type group. This helps to visualize which car type tends to be more fuel-efficient.\nNext step: I will calculate the p-value to asses the probability that the observed difference of 1.42 occurred by chance, and use a permutation test to determine whether this difference between small and large cars is statistically significant.\n\n\nshow code\nlibrary(tidyverse) \nset.seed(47) \n\nperm_null &lt;- function(data) {\n  shuffled &lt;- data |&gt; mutate(car_type = sample(car_type))\n  diff &lt;- mean(shuffled$combination_mpg[shuffled$car_type == \"small\"]) -\n          mean(shuffled$combination_mpg[shuffled$car_type == \"large\"])\n  return(diff)\n}\n\nperm_null_results &lt;- map_dbl(1:1000, ~ perm_null(cars_clean))  \n\nobs_diff &lt;- mean(cars_clean$combination_mpg[cars_clean$car_type == \"small\"]) - \n  mean(cars_clean$combination_mpg[cars_clean$car_type == \"large\"]) \n\n\np_value &lt;- mean(abs(perm_null_results) &gt;= abs(obs_diff)) \n\nggplot(data.frame(diff = perm_null_results), aes(x = diff)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins = 30, fill = \"lightblue\" , color = \"black\") + geom_vline(xintercept = obs_diff, color = \"red\", linewidth = 1) +\n  labs(title = \"Permutation Test: Null Distribution of Mean Differences\", \n       subtitle = \"Based on 1,000 shuffles of Car Type labels, P-value = 0.003\", \n       x = \"Difference in Mean MPG (Small - Large)\",\n       y = \"Frequency\") + theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistogram: This histogram demonstrates the distribution of mean MPG (miles-per-gallon) differences between small and large cars under 1,000 random shuffles of car types. The observed difference of 1.42 MPG is marked with the red vertical line. This visualizes the differences we’d expected by chance alone if car size had no effect on MPG (null hypothesis).\nInterpretation: The observed difference in mean MPG between small and large cars was 1.42, while the permutation test produced a p-value of 0.003. While the null hypothesis stated that car size has no effect on MPG and any observed difference is due to random chance, the low p-value (below 0.01) provides very strong evidence against the null hypothesis, suggesting that car size does indeed have a statistically significant effect on fuel efficiency.\nWrap-up: For my analysis, I compared the fuel efficiency (combined MPG) of small and large cars using data from the Car Specifications and Performance Data dataset. After categorizing the data (deciding which car classes were “small” and which were “large”), I visualized the difference in MPG between the two groups with a boxplot. I then conducted a permutation test with 1,000 random shuffles to assess whether the observed difference in mean MPG could be due to chance. The results provided strong evidence against the null hypothesis, suggesting that the difference in fuel efficiency between small and large cars is unlikely to be due to random variation. This information can help consumers like myself make more informed decisions when choosing a car that offers better long-term fuel efficiency."
